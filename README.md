## Excel Challenge: Crowdfunding Project Analysis

### Background

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

For this challenge I organized and analyzed a sample database of Crowdfunding initiative data to uncover certain trends. Through utilizing multiple excel capabilities from organizational and statistical functions, to manipulating pivot tables for visualizations - this project honed and sharpened my Excel skills and knowledge. Please see an overview of functions and skills learned and utilized below:
